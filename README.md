# Camping-Trip-Client

This is the client portion of an online multiplayer videogame project I made in the Unity cross-platform game engine. The images for this project were made using a combination of scanned hand-drawn images and digital images made using Procreate.

In this videogame a player is randomly chosen to play as the beast. All other players in the server play as human hunters who try to hunt the beast down and defeat it. While beasts have the ability to grab and carry hunters, climb trees, and transform into rocks, hunters can purchase weapons from an RV store in the home camp and light lanterns to illuminate their surroundings. Hunters make money everytime they deal damage to the beast, and highscores are decided based on how much money a hunter makes on a server. Highscores can be viewed by standing next to the campfire in the home camp.

## Demonstration Video

This is a video of the videogame being played on my High school's wireless network. It shows numerous students playing with eachother in realtime through a connection to the game server. In order to play there must be a game server and atleast one game client connected to the local network, and the local ip address of the game server must be entered into the address .txt file in the client project specialdata folder before compilation. Portforwarding can be used to connect to game servers hosted on a network outside of the local network. **I apologize for any offensive names that may appear in the demonstration video. I implemented a filter that prevents certain characters and phrases from being used to prevent player confusion, but I did not want to include a list of inappropriate phrases in the project files. The names students chose were out of my control.**
