# Camping-Trip-Client

This is the client portion of an online multiplayer videogame project I made in the Unity cross-platform game engine. The images for this project were made using a combination of scanned hand-drawn images and digital images made using Procreate. I worked on this project throughout about a month of my Sophomore year in High school.

## Demonstration Video

This is a video of the videogame being played on my High school's wireless network. It shows numerous students playing with eachother in realtime through a connection to the game server. In order to play there must be a game server and atleast one game client connected to a network, and the local ip address of the game server must be entered into the address .txt file in the client project specialdata folder before compilation.
