# Camping-Trip-Client

This is the client portion of an online multiplayer videogame I made in my sophomore year of high school using the cross-platform game engine Unity. The server portion can be found as another repository under my account. This client program communicates information (comprised of state data and bulkier, more comprehensive metadata) describing your player to the server program, which then dispatches similar information describing other players back to the client.

In this videogame a player is randomly chosen to play as the beast. All other players in the server play as hunters who attempt to hunt the beast down and defeat it. Beasts can grab hunters, climb trees and transform into rocks; hunters can use tools purchased from their home encampment, and they can light lanterns to illuminate their surroundings. Hunters make money everytime they injure the beast, and the highscore goes to the hunter with the most money on the server. Highscores can be viewed by standing next to the home campfire.

## Demonstration Video

This is a video of the videogame being played on my high school wireless network. It demonstrates students playing with eachother in realtime through their wireless connection to the game server. In order to play there must be a game server and atleast one game client connected to the game server via a local network.

**I apologize for any offensive student created player names that may appear in the demonstration video; I implemented a filter that prevents specific phrases from being used to prevent player confusion, but I really did not want to include a list of inappropriate phrases in the project files. The names chosen by students were out of my control.**
