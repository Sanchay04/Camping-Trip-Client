# Camping-Trip-Client

This is the client portion of the online multiplayer videogame I made in my sophomore year of highschool.

In this videogame a player is randomly chosen to play as the beast. All other players in the server play as human hunters who try to hunt the beast down and defeat it. While beasts have the ability to grab and carry hunters, climb trees, and transform into rocks, hunters can purchase weapons from an RV store in the home camp and light lanterns to illuminate their surroundings. Hunters make money everytime they deal damage to the beast, and highscores are decided based on how much money a hunter makes on a server. Highscores can be viewed by standing next to the campfire in the home camp.

## Demonstration Video

This is a video of the videogame being played on my highschool wireless network. It shows students playing with eachother in realtime through their wireless connection to the game server. In order to play there must be a game server and atleast one game client connected to the local network. Portforwarding can be used to connect to game servers hosted on a network outside of the local network. 

**I apologize for any offensive student names that may appear in the demonstration video; I implemented a filter that prevents specific phrases from being used to prevent player confusion, but I did not want to include a list of inappropriate phrases in the project files. The names chosen by students were out of my control.**
